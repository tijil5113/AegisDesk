## 🔧 Configuration

### AI Assistant Setup

The AI Assistant uses a secure serverless API endpoint to keep your API key safe. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Serverless API (Recommended - Secure)

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (or similar platform with serverless functions):
   - Connect your repository to Vercel
   - Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
   - The `/api/chat.js` endpoint will handle API calls securely
   - No API key needed in the browser!

2. **Get your OpenAI API key**:
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy it to your deployment platform's environment variables

#### Option 2: Client-Side (Legacy - Less Secure)

If you're running locally without a serverless function:
1. Open the Settings app
2. Navigate to "AI Assistant" section
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. The key is stored locally in your browser

**Note**: The serverless API approach is recommended for production deployments as it keeps your API key secure on the server side.

### Weather API

The weather app uses Open-Meteo API (free, no key required) for real-time weather data. If the API is unavailable, it falls back to sample data.

## 💡 Tips

- **Persistent Data**: All your tasks, notes, and settings are saved automatically

  - If using serverless API: Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your deployment platform
  - If using client-side: Make sure you've entered a valid OpenAI API key in Settings
  - Check browser console for error messages
- **Windows not saving position**: Clear your browser cache and try again
- **Data not persisting**: Ensure localStorage is enabled in your browser
